  MP3 Shield Trigger

  This is an example MP3 trigger sketch for the SparkFun MP3 Shield.
  Pins 0, 1, 5, 10, A0, A1, A2, A3, and A4 are setup to trigger tracks
  "track001.mp3", "track002.mp3", etc. on an SD card loaded into
  the shield. Whenever any of those pins are shorted to ground,
  their respective track will start playing.

  When a new pin is triggered, any track currently playing will
  stop, and the new one will start.

  A5 is setup to globally STOP playing a track when triggered.

  If you need more triggers, the shield's jumpers on pins 3 and 4 
  (MIDI-IN and GPIO1) can be cut open and used as additional
  trigger pins. Also, because pins 0 and 1 are used as triggers
  Serial is not available for debugging. Disable those as
  triggers if you want to use serial.

  Much of this code was grabbed from the FilePlayer example
  included with the SFEMP3Shield library. Major thanks to Bill
  Porter and Michael Flaga, again, for this amazing library!

  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN ESP8266 YET. ONLY ARDUINO AND IT WORKED. TO MAKE IT WORK IN ESP8266 YOU WILL NEED
  TO CHANGE SFEMP3ShieldConfig.h and right below #include <pins_arduino.h> put a new condition for ESP8266 that will
  map to ESP8266 pins. Alternatively, you may not do this because it has an else catch all statement. If you use the same
  mappings it should work. NOTE: NOTE: NOTE: the shield is on ***5V*** so you will need a separate input for it.
