/*
 * This is a sample of a UPnP service that runs on a IoT device.
 * 
 * UPnP commands/queries can be used from an application or a script.
 *
 * This service is an Alarm output.
 * It gathers input from sensors and sends signal upon input when armed.
 * So it keeps track of whether it is armed, and either safe or in alarm,
 * but not much else.
 * Authentication of RFID or validation of the code entered on a keypad
 * is not the scope of this module.
